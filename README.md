Project-Banter
==============
This one of the personal projects I am working on, its an instant messaging app 
I have striped away a lot of the detail and just left in the skeleton user interface elements
I believe it demonstrates particular coding design concepts such as MVC, Delegation and Dynamics but to mention a few. 
Its pretty easy and simply to understand.
